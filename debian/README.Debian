The authors of Template Toolkit have also created detailed
documentation and examples written as TT2 libraries and source files
which are built into HTML.

You can find this documentation on the web here:

http://template-toolkit.org/docs/index.html

Downloadable version of documentation is available online here

http://template-toolkit.org/download/#html_docs

Be wary that this documentation is often out of date from the latest
version of the library.
